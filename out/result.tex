    \section{Brief View}
    \subsection{Pre-Processing}
    In the processing, document texts and their labels are extracted from the \emph{raw muc}.
    We should keep:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Indexes of Both \textbf{sentences from one `group of k' in one line}
        and \textbf{list of sentences from one `group of k'}.
        \item Indexes of Labels for each word.
        \item Tokenized words.
    \end{itemize}
    Take continuous $k$ sentences in one paragraph for each training batch.
    \subsection{Batchify data}
    In this section, the main purpose is to pad the data to maximum length. Apply it to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sentences from one `group of k' in one line, which means we pad each sentence to
        the maximum length of \textbf{batch}.
        \item Labels from one `group of k' in one line, same as the above description.
        \item Pad to the maximum length of sentences in one group. It is considered as an optimization.
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Model}
    About word embedding \ref{embedding}, LSTM \ref{lstm}, concat \ref{concat} and CRF \ref{crf}.
    \subsubsection{Word Embedding}\label{embedding}
    Both Glove and Bert are used in the embedding layer, which means we have word-self and
    contextualized meanings. Because of Bert model, better use bert tokenize to get a good result.
    \subsubsection{LSTM}\label{lstm}
    LSTM requires same length data for each batch.\\
    Pay attention to the usage of \emph{pack\_padded\_sequence}. Remember to do it on both of the two docs.
    \subsubsection{Concat}\label{concat}
    Although simple sum function is mentioned in the paper, the author only apply gate and sigmoid to
    outputs of linear(lstm\_out).
    \subsubsection{CRF}\label{crf}
    Lets try \emph{pytorch-crf} package. It is supposed to excel hand-made crf.
    \section{Details}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There is a scale factor in the embedding, which equals $\sqrt{\frac{embedding\_dim}{3}}$.
        It's for the cases when word not find in the pre-trained embedding dict. We apply random vector range in $(-scale, scale)$.
        \item Output of the \emph{pad\_packed\_sequence} is shaped like $(seq\_len, batch\_size, *)$.
        There is a transpose with dropout layer.
        \item If optimizer is set to `SGD', we apply dynamical learning rate to the model, which is $\frac{lr}{1 + epoch \times decacy\_rate}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \section{Questions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What does \emph{feature\_prefix} do?
        \item There are extra empty data suffixed at the return Tensor of \emph{read\_instance}.
        \item In \emph{calculate\_PZ\_} from CRF model, view score to \emph{[batch size, sequence len, tag size, tag size]} then transpose? 
    \end{enumerate}
    \section{Optimization}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We have to match the tokens with roles one by one when using tokenized words.
        A faster procession is expected when solved by KMP. 
        \item For sentence level lstm, trying to take the whole paragraph as one batch,
        instead of send them through LSTM layer sentence by sentence.
        \item Remove some redundant arguments or variables.
        \item Detailed Annotation.
    \end{enumerate}
